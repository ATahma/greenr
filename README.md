 - Greenr is a project that involved nudging, by a Virtual Assistant (Google's) to propose a more environmentally-friendly lifestyle
 - It is entirely written in JavaScript and the code is written over the code Google provides in Google Codelabs Levels 1,2 and 3
 - The point is to remind users about small yet significant habits that can be beneficial in long-term for the environment.
 
### TODO list:
- [ ] Establish a reward systen
- [ ] Set early goal with the user
- [ ] Give an estimate on user's carbon footprint in addition to the link to the website where they can see it themselves!
